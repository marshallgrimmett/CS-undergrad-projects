RPG Plan

cool ideas
  - When a new player creates an account, map increases by 1x1
  - player pay to own areas of the map, except AOI and towns
    - safer near towns, more dangerous near AOI
    - players can own an area near AOI, but risk their stuff being stolen/destroyed
    - if your place is attacked or ransacked, it becomes deserted and becomes a normal area, but still owned by player
    - if player is inactive for 7 days, their areas go up for auction and the proceeds go to the player

Bugs
  - Game over bug: ? appears where player quit early
  - Random nodes needs to be different

needed
  - Area class
  - Town class
  - AOI class

classes
  - character info: skills, health, energy,
  - inventory
  - map

Map
  - Lets start with the map at 16x16
  - Towns and areas of interest are fixed locations
  - normal areas contain random stuff

Moving
  - out of bounds
  - change symbol to you
  - change previous symbol to ' ' unless a town or AOI
  If w, currLocation = prevLocation, y++(only change), yourLocation = you
